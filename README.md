# Advent of Code 2025

This is my personal repo for the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/).

## How to run

To run the code, first create an `input.dat` file in the subdirectory related to the day (i.e. put your input for day `1` in `1/input.dat`). Then run the code for the day and part of the puzzle from the root directiory using python (e. g. `$ python 1/b.py`).
